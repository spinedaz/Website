Here I want to share the process of my thesis and some useful links for those who are learning about landscape ecology like me. 

### My thesis


- Tutorials

- Unsolved and solved questions

    - **Selection of species**:

    For what species should we prioritize conservation efforts? This is not a trivial question, and researchers and conservation managers have been thinking about it for a while. 

    This was the first question I encountered. How should I choose the species to carry out a national analysis of connectivity?

    My objective was to propose corridors that could protect a wide range of species, this is often called a multispecies approach. However, in one of the most diverse countries in the world, trying to put all species in one box is a titanic and nonsense decision.
    
    Then, instead of focusing on species characteristics per sé, the approach was based on habitat selection and threats for a big number species.

    First the thread: It is not a secret that deforestation is a big problem in Colombia and the derived fragmentation is endangering the habitats of a miriad of species. There are species more sensitive to this fragmentation, for example those who have very restricted distributions or species with very specific prefered covers.

    This is the case of endangered species listed in the Resolución 1912 de 2017. Although this document has hundreds of endangered species, the focus was on mammals, because we wanted to model terrestrial connectivity and because this group is often used in connectivity analysis because they are particularly sensitive to the barrier effect caused by roads, and due to the fact that areas and linkages required by them can be also used by multiple other species and ecological fluxes (Gurrutxaga et al., 2011).

    Then, we grouped this species into something called **ecological profiles**, which is more or less groups of species that share certain characteristics between each other. For my case each group shares a prefered type of land cover, and also they inhabit similar altitudinal ranges.

    This is still an unsolved question. Although I chose one way to answer it for my thesis, I would like to use an algorithm to prioritize them, which in my knowledge is not done for Colombia. A great example for future research related to this topic is this awesome paper: [Faunal surrogates for forest species conservation: A systematic niche-based approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.084).

### Useful links and resources

#### THE TOOLS

- I used [Gnarly Landscape Utilities](https://circuitscape.org/gnarly-landscape-utilities/) to create my resistance surface. In the webpage you can download the tool and also tutorials provided by circuitscape.

- The one and only [Linkage mapper](https://linkagemapper.org/). 

#### Know how about corridors

The [Corridor design webpage](http://corridordesign.org/) brings you real study cases about connectivity planning and corridor design.

A very good and concise review about corridor design: [Forks in the road: Choices in Procedures for Designing Wildland Linkages](./Documents/2008_Beier etal_ConsBiol.LinkageDesigns.pdf). I used it to put my ideas in order for the creative process of my thesis. It answered a lot of my questions in just a few pages of reading.

If you are looking for something more ellaborated, they also have this manual: [Conceptual steps for designing corridors](./Documents/ConceptualStepsForDesigningCorridors.pdf)


#### Tutorials and courses

- I want to start with Steve Padgett webpage, which was the most useful resource I could have found when I was starting. Below this text, you can find a linkage mapper tutorial based on Steven's thesis carried out in Costa Rica. Check it out if you want to get a very good first glimpse of linkage mapper. I also share the link to his webpage: [Steve Padgett Webpage](http://www.stevepadgettvasquez.com/ontheweb)

- An very nice course in landscape ecology for free: [Landscape ecology edx](https://www.edx.org/es/course/landscape-ecology)

- Learning Landscape Ecology is a complete practical guide that compiles concepts and techniques on landscape ecology: In this website you will find all the files to solve the exercises and labs suggested in the book [Learning landscape ecology](http://sarahgergel.net/lel/learning-landscape-ecology/)
