Here I want to share the process of my thesis and some useful links for those who are learning about landscape ecology like me. This webpage will be divided in at least two sections, one where I'll share some of my personal advice and tutorials based on my thesis and another one much more formal (the one you can actyually trust) with references and tutorials of experts on the field.

### My thesis


### Useful links and resources

#### Know how about corridors

#### Tutorials

I want to start with Steve Padgett webpage, which was the most useful resource I could have found when I was starting. In the link I share here, there is a linkage mapper tutorial based on Steven's thesis carried out in Costa Rica. Check it out if you want to get a very good first glimpse of linkage mapper.
