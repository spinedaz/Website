Here I want to share the process of my thesis and some useful links for those who are learning about landscape ecology like me. This webpage will be divided in at least two sections, one where I'll share some of my personal advice and tutorials based on my thesis and another one much more formal and the one you can trust with references and tutorials of experts on this field.

### My thesis


### Useful links and resources

#### Know how about corridors
