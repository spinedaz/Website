Here I want to share the process of my thesis and some useful links for those who are learning about landscape ecology like me. This webpage will be divided in at least two sections, one where I'll share some of my personal advice and tutorials based on my thesis and another one much more formal (the one you can actyually trust) with references and tutorials of experts on the field.

### My thesis


### Useful links and resources

#### THE TOOLS

- I used [Gnarly Landscape Utilities](https://circuitscape.org/gnarly-landscape-utilities/) to create my resistance surface. In the webpage you can download the tool and also tutorials provided by circuitscape. However, I will leave here the link to download only the [toolbox](./Tools/Gnarly Landscape Utilities.tbx).

- The one and only [Linkage mapper] (https://linkagemapper.org/). 

#### Know how about corridors

The [Corridor design webpage](http://corridordesign.org/) brings you real study cases about connectivity planning and corridor design.

A very good and concise review about corridor design: [Forks in the road: Choices in Procedures for Designing Wildland Linkages](./Documents/2008_Beier etal_ConsBiol.LinkageDesigns.pdf). I used it to put my ideas in order for the creative process of my thesis. It answered a lot of my questions in just a few pages of reading.

If you are looking for something more ellaborated, they also have this manual: [Conceptual steps for designing corridors](./Documents/ConceptualStepsForDesigningCorridors.pdf)


#### Tutorials

I want to start with Steve Padgett webpage, which was the most useful resource I could have found when I was starting. In the link I share here, there is a linkage mapper tutorial based on Steven's thesis carried out in Costa Rica. Check it out if you want to get a very good first glimpse of linkage mapper.
